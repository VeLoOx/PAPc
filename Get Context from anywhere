You could do something like this.-

public static Drawable getDrawable(String name) {
    Context context = YourApplication.getContext();
    int resourceId = context.getResources().getIdentifier(name, "drawable", YourApplication.getContext().getPackageName());
    return context.getResources().getDrawable(resourceId);
}

In order to access the context from anywhere, you may extend Application class.-

public class YourApplication extends Application {

    private static YourApplication instance;

    public YourApplication() {
        instance = this;
    }

    public static Context getContext() {
        return instance;
    }
}

And map it in your Manifest application tag

<application
    android:name=".YourApplication"
    ....

Thank you, I never know I can get the context this way before. It seems that it will make the codes cleaner. â€“ hguser May 4 '13 at 2:18
